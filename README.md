# Datatonism

Datatonism is a virtual adaptation of the Dataton System 3000 created by Bj√∂rn Sandlund in the 1970s. The name and main patch is inspired by [Automatonism](https://www.automatonism.com/), a modular synth system created for Pure Data.

It consists of 12 modules - 3 source modules, 5 manipulating modules, and 4 editing modules.

### Requirements / Startup guide
To use Datatonism, you simply download the repository and open the patch called `main.pd`. Apart from needing Pure Data, the `moonlib` library for Pd is also required.

### Help-files
Help-files for the modules are still a work in process. However, most modules have a short description in the patch. They are located in in the `patch_editor_abs`-folder.
